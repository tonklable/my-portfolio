## Description
ReFoodable is a **Flutter** project submitted for **GDSC Solution Challenge 2023**. This project aims to reduce leftover food at the end of the day by providing service to share discounts from restaurants and supermarkets.

## Introduction
17% of global food production went into waste bins and 39% of this food waste comes from food service and retail. Leftover food contributes a part of overall food waste in the world. Goal 12 from sustainable development goals (SDGs) aims to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. On target 12.3, they aim to cut half per capita global food waste by 2030 at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses. ReFoodable aims to reduce leftover food from stores, restaurants, and supermarkets at the end of the day according to the target 12.3 of SDGs. We utilized Google technology including Flutter, Firebase and Google Map Platform.

## Details
Refoodable provides a service for stores and restaurants to upload their leftover food or bento boxes with discounted prices to their store pages to make users get notified and buy the food to reduce food waste. The application also provides access for other users to add the discounted food they see to the store page as well.

I contributed to this project as a Flutter developer. I participated in the entire development process from brainstorming, UI designing, feature defining and prioritization, development, and user testing.

My main tasks are mainly on designing, user testing, and front-end development. One of the features which I took care of was to give store users the ability to save the list of recurring food in order that they do not have to add new food to the list one by one every single day. I also took care of the registration page, store page, food listing page, and food card in terms of both UI and development.

In a test involving real users, our application received an average rating of 4 out of 5, demonstrating a considerable impact. Users provided feedback, explaining that they could identify with the problem and perceived our app as an essential resource for connecting customers and businesses. To enhance our app's scope and potential influence, we incorporated customer feedback and introduced incentives to encourage customer participation.
