## Description
This project won the **Product Award** from **Build@Mercari 2023**. Build@Mercari 2023 is a 2-week training program and 1-week hackathon for training aspiring software engineers. This program is officially supported by Mercari Inc. one of the biggest e-commerce companies in Japan.

## Details
The theme of this hackathon is to improve Mini Mercari by editing UI, adding features, improving API, handling errors, etc. There is a benchmark to score our backend from test passing rate and efficiency. 

In our product, we aimed to develop a product that is intuitive, interactive, and intelligent. We have done a lot of features including a comment section with replies (that as a Mercari user, I really want it to exist), searching, filtering and editing items. We also have done optimization in page navigation, error handling and transaction management on the backend side.
