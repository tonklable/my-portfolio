## Description
This is a product management project in Japan Product Camp 2022. In this project, we include most parts we learned from this camp including user research, persona, problem analysis, prototype, success metrics and go-to-market strategy. The purpose of this project is to help new users have a good experience to sell their items more easily in Mercari.

## Why Mercari?
We would like to explore e-commerce platforms in Japan. We got the challenge to promote decluttering to people, and Mercari is one of the biggest e-commerce platforms that encourage their users to decluttering behavior. Creating and designing new features to help users declutter by taking Mercari as a case study will help us to understand e-commerce users more.

## Problems & Solutions
We came up with problems & solutions in the following diagram. Please see the slide for details and prototypes.
