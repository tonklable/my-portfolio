# Introduction
17% of global food production went into waste bins and 39% of this food waste comes from food service and retail. Leftover food contributes a part of overall food waste in the world. Goal 12 from sustainable development goals (SDGs) aims to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. On target 12.3, they aim to cut half per capita global food waste by 2030 at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses. ReFoodable aims to reduce leftover food from stores, restaurants, and supermarkets at the end of the day according to the target 12.3 of SDGs. We utilized Google technology including Flutter, Firebase and Google Map Platform.
